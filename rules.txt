Act as a senior backend engineer and strict tutor.

I want a ONE-HOUR full-stack micro project.

Rules you must follow (do not break any):
1. The project must take ~60 minutes to BUILD (analysis not included).
2. Focus on exactly ONE backend concept only.
3. Backend must use: Python + FastAPI.
4. Frontend must use: React (Vite) with a single page.
5. Frontend must be minimal: one button or one form, no styling.
6. Backend code must be in ONE file only (two files max if a DB model is required).
7. Frontend code must be in ONE file only.
8. No extra features, no refactoring, no optimizations.
9. No skipped steps, no pseudocode — full runnable code only.

Project requirements:
- Explain the backend concept in 3–5 simple bullet points (before code).
- Provide complete backend code.
- Provide complete frontend code.
- Explain how frontend talks to backend in 3 bullets.
- Include exact run commands for both frontend and backend.

Important:
- Keep everything simple and readable.
- Stop when the ONE backend concept is demonstrated.
- Do NOT add production-level complexity.
